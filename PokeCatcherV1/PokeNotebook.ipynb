    "Project Description: Pokemon Catcher V1\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokemon Catcher V1 is a Python command-line game that allows users to catch and view information about various Pokemon they've caught.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Catching Pokemon: Players can type 'pokemon' to catch a random Pokemon from a pool of over 1300 different pokemon. Each caught Pokemon is added to the player's Pokedex.\n",
    "Viewing Pokedex: Players can type 'pokedex' to view a list of all the Pokemon they have caught so far. The Pokedex displays the unique Pokemon caught and their progress towards completion of the PokeDex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "api.py: Contains functions to interact with the PokeAPI to fetch information about Pokemon.\n",
    "utils.py: Includes utility functions to handle random Pokemon generation and formatting Pokemon data.\n",
    "PokeNotebook.ipynb: Main module that orchestrates the game loop and user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Play:\n",
    "\n",

    "Extra Credit Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "Prior to this course, I had some experience with C++, but I was relatively new to Python programming. Although I had a basic understanding of programming concepts, I found certain aspects challenging, particularly file organization, making API calls, and handling JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the development of the final project, I went above and beyond the requirements in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "I took extra care to organize my project files into separate modules (api.py, utils.py, tests.py) to improve code readability and maintainability. This involved creating clear boundaries between different functionalities and ensuring each module had a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "I delved into understanding how to make API calls using Python's requests library and how to parse JSON data returned from these calls. This involved researching and experimenting with different API endpoints, understanding request parameters, and handling responses effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "I added extra features to enhance the user experience. For example, I implemented error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors, providing messages to the user. I also incorporated HTML formatting for better visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, I continuously sought out additional resources and tutorials to deepen my understanding of Python programming concepts and best practices. I actively engaged with online communities, such as Stack Overflow and programming forums, to seek advice and solutions to challenges encountered during development. In the process of completing the project, I learned valuable skills in project organization, API integration, JSON data handling, and error handling. These experiences have not only expanded my technical skills but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities and confidence as a programmer."
